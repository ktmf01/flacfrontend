------                             FAQ                               ------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Why is this command line thing popping up?
FLAC frontend is a very simple program that just calls the 'real' FLAC
encoder, which is command line based. This has been done to keep
development of FLAC frontend easy and accessible and makes it possible to
change the encoder without having to change anything in the FLAC frontend

2) Is there drag and drop support?
Yes, there is. Just drag any files or directories to the list box in the
top left of the FLAC frontend window. Any directories will automatically be
searched (recursively) for .flac, .ogg, .oga and .wav files.

3) Where is FLAC tester?
FLAC tester has been replaced by the frontend, because the frontend now has
drag-and-drop support too. Just drag the files you want to test to the FLAC
Frontend and click the test button.

4) How does the portable version of FLAC Frontend work?
Just unzip the zip-file somewhere convenient and run the executable, either
FLAC frontend-NET20.exe or FLAC frontend-NET40.exe, depending on which
version of the .NET framework you have installed. If you have .NET 2.0, 3.0
or 3.5 you should use NET20, if you have .NET 4.0 or 4.5 use NET40. If you
are not sure, just try both. You can just delete the other file if you
don't want to have to remember which one is the right one.
